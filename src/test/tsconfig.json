 * This tsconfig file is for executing unit tests. Unit tests are run with Mocha

 * Due to strange behavior resulting in Mocha attempting to locate the tsconfig
 * file outside of the root directory of this npm package, this tsconfig file
 * can't extend the tsconfig file located at the root of this directory. Hence,
 * having to copy/repeat properties that are also set in the root tsconfig file.

# Compare API

This API's purpose is to make comparing 2 JavaScript objects to each other more
convenient. It achieves this by providing classes and functions that make
it easier to query the differences and similarities between the objects being
compared to each other.

This documentation is intended to provide a deeper and more technical
overview of how the `Compare` API functions. For a more general overview, the
[README][1] for the repo does a good job concisely summing up how the package
can be used and would be a better starting point than this documentation if you
haven't read it already.
